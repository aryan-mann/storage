;;; This library defines a data type
;;; for lexical tokens of the PROC programming language,
;;; as described in section 3.3 of
;;; _Essentials of programming languages_, third edition
;;; (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2008; ISBN 978-0-262-06279-4),
;;; by Daniel P. Friedman and Mitchell Wand.

;;; PROC has tokens of fourteen kinds:
;;; "numbers" (actually, numerals),
;;; identifiers, minus signs, open- and close-parentheses,
;;; commas, equals signs,
;;; and the keywords zero?, if, then, else, let, in, and proc.

(define-library (PROC tokens)
  (export token? numeral-token minus-sign open-parenthesis comma
          close-parenthesis zero?-token if-token then-token else-token
          identifier-token let-token equals-sign in-token proc-token)
  (import (scheme base)
          (utilities eopl))
  (begin

    ;; A single define-datatype declaration
    ;; accommodates all of these tokens as variants.

    (define-datatype token token?
      (numeral-token (value exact-integer?))
      (minus-sign)
      (open-parenthesis)
      (comma)
      (close-parenthesis)
      (zero?-token)
      (if-token)
      (then-token)
      (else-token)
      (identifier-token (id identifier?))
      (let-token)
      (equals-sign)
      (in-token)
      (proc-token))))
