;;; This library defines a data type
;;; for expressed values of the PROC programming language,
;;; as described in section 3.3 of
;;; _Essentials of programming languages_, third edition
;;; (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2008; ISBN 978-0-262-06279-4),
;;; by Daniel P. Friedman and Mitchell Wand.
;;; It also defines simple environments,
;;; as described in section 2.2 of that book.
;;; The two datatypes are presented together
;;; because they are mutually recursive.
